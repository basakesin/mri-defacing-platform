MRI Defacing Platform is a unified web-based interface that brings together multiple state-of-the-art MRI defacing and anonymization tools into a single, easy-to-use system for neuroimaging researchers and clinicians.

This API requires external neuroimaging tools to be installed separately:

- FSL (bet, quickshear, deepdefacer)
- FreeSurfer (mri_deface)

These tools must be available in the system PATH.
